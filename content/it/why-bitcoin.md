IT - Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last decade, with almost no correlation with the other asset classes. When added to a diversified asset allocation, Bitcoin reduces overall financial risks for a given expected return or, alternatively, increases expected return for a given level of risk. Digital and scriptural, Bitcoin only exists as validated transaction. It can be transferred but not duplicated (i.e. it can be spent, but not double-spent): it is scarce in the digital realm, as nothing else before. It mimics the gold monetary policy of decreasing incremental extraction: Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of gold with a secure uncensorable embedded settlement network. Bitcoin is a bearer instrument: if you lose your Bitcoin keys you lose your Bitcoin. We are here to help you store your Bitcoins safely.
