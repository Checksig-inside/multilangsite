Internet disconnected as defense from remote hacks, our main custody solution has two levels. The cold storage is directly managed by CheckSig and it is always empty except during withdrawals; the “frozen” storage with all assets is managed by multiple external legal entities whose only ability is to jointly move funds to cold storage when technically enabled by us. Both levels are multi-signatures and operated from different geographic locations.
